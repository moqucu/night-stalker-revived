The game begins immediately, with the man inside
the center bunker. His loaded weapon is lying in
the maze and is flashing. The man must leave the
bunker and land on the weapon to pick it up.

Press the Disc on your hand controller to move the
man through the maze. Press the Disc edge in the
direction you want the man to go.

Once the man has picked up the weapon, he has
six bullets and can now shoot in four different

directions.

NOTE: The man can run and shoot, but he cannot
do both at once! Also you can only fire off a shot
when the man is standing still and he has the
weapon
